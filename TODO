spend money to raise more troops

NPC countries should do things during tick (raise troops, attack...)

some countries have siginificant oil, some do not

each country has a set of resources it supplies and demands

a conquered country with 0 occupying troops will likely overthrow and restore self-government

conquered country's owner can loot it, taking it's money and resources

NPC countries can have a list of countries they don't like (may attack)

occupying force size required to keep a conquered country subdued is proportional to native population, plus a factor representing how much of a resistance they put up, plus maybe the land area. So China with high land and pop would be fairly difficult to keep occupied

each NPC country has it's own AI (class/function) that is executed during the tick, in order that each country his its own unique personality, strategy, quirks, etc.

when any battles occur in a country, some civ pop may die
